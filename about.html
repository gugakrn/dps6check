<h1>About DPS6Check</h1>

<p>
DPS6Check is an independent educational project created to provide clear and
structured information about the Ford DPS6 (Powershift) dual-clutch transmission.

<p>
The purpose of this website is to help vehicle owners better understand how
certain transmission parameters behave over time, based on learned values and
usage patterns commonly observed in real-world scenarios.
</p>

This project is not affiliated with Ford Motor Company or any vehicle
manufacturer. All content published here is based on technical study, practical
experience and publicly available information.

Any tools or reference calculators available on this website are strictly
educational in nature. They do not measure physical wear, do not provide
diagnosis and do not replace professional mechanical inspection or official
service procedures.

and informed decision-making, avoiding misinformation and oversimplified claims
